#  MSGF-hub

This is the monorepository that contains an example of a Business Process based System, the MSG Foundation study case from the book "Object-Oriented and Classical Software Engineering" (Stephen R. Schach. 2010).

The MSG Foundation grants mortgage credits to young couples for the purchase of their house, so this business process-based software implements the credit requests process. The foundation's name refers to the acronym of its founder and philanthropist Martha Stockton Greengage.

## Description

This development was carried out with two objectives:

* Obtain the set of software artifacts that make up a business process-based information system, using Camunda as the process engine (in its community 7 version).  

* Use this information system to apply a traceability framework that facilitates its evolution. This framework is based on Java annotations, whose definitions can be found at this [Annotations definitions GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BPMN-sw-evol/MSGF-hub/tree/main/annotations).

This mono repository contains the various modules shown in the following architecture:

## Applications

1. **BPM-Engine**: program that integrates the Camunda process engine in its version 7 in a Spring Boot project persisting the whole schema to a PostgreSQL database. [Repository Link](https://github.com/BPMN-sw-evol/MSGF-hub/tree/main/BPM-Engine)

2. **CreditRequest**: program that manages all credit requests from customers. There you can create a new request and follow up on it. [Repository Link](https://github.com/BPMN-sw-evol/MSGF-hub/tree/main/CreditRequest)

3. **CentralSys**: program that manages all credit requests from customers at the organization level. This is where the organization's employees follow up on their assigned tasks. [Repository Link](https://github.com/BPMN-sw-evol/MSGF-hub/tree/main/CentralSys)

4. **Treasury**: program that manages the financial movements when a credit request is approved by the treasury office. [Repository Link](https://github.com/BPMN-sw-evol/MSGF-hub/tree/main/Treasury)

5. **annotations**: as part of the business process variable traceability project, some customized annotations were implemented in order to identify how these variables are traced in the source code. Here is the definition of the annotations using a Java project. [Repository Link](https://github.com/BPMN-sw-evol/MSGF-hub/tree/main/annotations)

## Technologies

The applications created in this implementation were developed using the Java programming language, mainly taking advantage of the Spring Boot development framework as well as the Camunda 7 platform for business process management.

[Spring initializr](https://start.spring.io/) is a tool that streamlines the creation of Spring Boot projects by integrating various dependencies such as Spring Data JPA, Spring Web, Lombok, Thymeleaf, and DevTools. Spring Boot improves the development process by providing out-of-the-box solutions for common challenges, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure configuration.

In addition, [Camunda Platform 7](https://camunda.com/platform-7/) has been used for the design and implementation of business processes. Camunda is an open source workflow and decision automation platform based on the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) and DMN (Decision Model and Notation) standards. It offers powerful workflow management capabilities, allowing organizations to effectively model, automate and optimize business processes. Camunda's flexible and scalable architecture makes it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from automating simple tasks to complex enterprise workflows.

## Installation requirements

To use the set of applications that compose the MSGF information system you need the following:

1. **Version control system**: Install GIT from the [GIT official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **IntelliJ IDEA**: To run and/or modify the project, you can download it from the [IntelliJ official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/download/?section=windows).

3. **Docker and Docker-Compose**: To use Docker correctly follow the steps below:
   - Step 1: According to your need Use the following command to install WSL2 
     - ```wsl --list --o``` to know the available distributions. 
     - ```wsl --install -d "distribution-version"``` to install WSL2 with a specific distribution. 
     - Use the following command for upgrade to WSL2 ```wsl --version```
     - If you want to know the installed WSL version ```wsl --set-default-version 2``` to change the version to WSL2.
   - Step 2: Install Docker from the official website.(If you already have Docker Desktop installed, skip this step).
   - Step 3: Create a Docker Hub account from the official website, and log in to Docker Desktop. (If you already have an account, log in directly to Docker Desktop)
   

5. **Java**: Install Java from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).
   - Step 1: Download MSI installer version.
     
6. **Maven**: Install Apache Maven from the [official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
   - Step 1: Add the **bin** folder path to the environment variables.

7. **PostgreSQL** Install PostgresSQL from the [official website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).
   - Step 1: Download the version for your operating system.
   - Step 2: In the installation process, leave the default port 5432.
      ![PostgreSQL PORT](docs/Port.png)
   - Step 3: The username must be "postgres" and the password must be "admin".

## Usage

To use this program you must:

1. Verify that the Docker daemon is running.

2. Open a terminal in the folder where you want to download the program and clone it with:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BPMN-sw-evol/MSGF-hub.git
   ```

3. You should run the build-and-run.sh file as follows (if you are on a Windows operating system use Git Bash):

   ```
   ./build-and-run.sh
   ```

4. Wait a moment while the images and containers are built and the services are launched. This depends on your computing power.
   
5. You are done! After that you can interact with the MSG-Foundation systems. 

   * BPM-Engine works on port 9000.
   * CreditRequest works on port 9001.
   * CentralSys works on port 9003.
   * Treasury works on port 9004.
